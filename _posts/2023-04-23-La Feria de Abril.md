 La Feria de Abril is a spring festival held annually in Seville, where the public gathers in a large enclosure called the Real de la Feria, with flamenco and Sevillian costumes,the streets are covered with ephemeral booths, decorated with lanterns, through which riders and horse-drawn carriages circulate and bring families and people attending to their booths . As they say “Casetas”
 
This is my favorite place to go and experience all things Spanish. Flamenco and traditional music, food and clothes.
To enter the fairgrounds you must first pass through the massive Golden Gates, these are illuminated by lights. Every year the main entrance to La Feria is changed and it is a spectacular sight that leaves you amazed.

I attended  La Feria in 2022 and 2023 , however in 2023 the temperature was 46 degrees , which is on the hotter end of the scale. Never the less the women wear elegant flamenco dresses and the men in suits, The men on horses wear a style of clothing called “Gitano”. They will arrive to the fair on the horse and the ladies sit sidesaddle.

This Fair even though open to the public, to enter the tents you must be a invited in by somebody who is a member of the hosting tent, as there is security on the enterence of each door. I will leave you with a short video
