 La Feria de Abril is a spring festival held annually in Seville, where the public gathers in a large enclosure called the Real de la Feria, with flamenco and Sevillian costumes,the streets are covered with ephemeral booths, decorated with lanterns, through which riders and horse-drawn carriages circulate and bring families and people attending to their booths . As they say “Casetas”
 
This is my favorite place to go and experience all things Spanish. Flamenco and traditional music, food and clothes.
To enter the fairgrounds you must first pass through the massive Golden Gates, these are illuminated by lights. Every year the main entrance to La Feria is changed and it is a spectacular sight that leaves you amazed.
