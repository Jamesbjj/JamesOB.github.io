In February 2023 I visited Cadiz In the south of Spain “Andalucia” Weere I got to visit my favorite Flamenco artist Cameron de la isla,  he has passed away many years ago however I got to visit his Tomb and a Museum in this home village in San Fernando, Cadiz.

I love Cadiz because of the simple nature and way of living it's like taking a step back in time.


After this I visited my friends in a little village 40 minutes away from Cadiz in Chipiona,  I was  attending a local festival called Carnavales, which is almost like Halloween as people dress up and like to have a little party. The sunsets here are beautiful and you'll get a beer for 1 euro .

I'll leave you with a few pictures.
